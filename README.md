# User Management Script

This script creates users and assigns them to specified groups based on a provided user list file. It is designed to run in environments where `sudo` is not available, such as Git Bash on Windows.

## Usage

Run the script with the user list file as an argument:

```bash
./create_users.sh users.txt
